## 📦 Components

### ✏️ Class Periods

A central page that keeps track of my current class period and provides resources pertaining to the class I am currently in. The center of the screen features the current time, the name of the current class, and helpful links (a calendar for the class and the Google Classroom page). The top of the screen provides a progress bar that fills up green as the class period carries on.

### 🍪 Cookie Clicker

A very simple "cookie clicker" game that features simple power-ups, such as a "Click Doubler" that doubles the amount of points awarded per click and a "Square Producer" that produces additional points every second. The cost for each power-up automatically increases on each purchase.

### 🏠 Homepage

A rudimentary personal website with detailed descriptions on how I built various projects.
